# Asteroid Hazard Classification
This project aims to classify potentially hazardous asteroids (PHA) using a neural network model trained on a dataset provided by NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The dataset includes physical and orbital characteristics of asteroids, and the task focuses on addressing class imbalance by applying SMOTE to improve detection of hazardous asteroids.

## About the Dataset

The dataset is officially maintained by NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology. JPL provides up-to-date information on small bodies in the solar system, including asteroids, their orbits, and physical properties.

- Dataset source: [Asteroid Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakhawat18/asteroid-dataset/data)  
- Contents: Physical features (diameter, albedo, mass, etc.), orbital parameters (eccentricity, semi-major axis, inclination, etc.), and hazard classification (PHA flag).

### Key Columns

| Column Name | Description                                     |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `pha`       | Potentially Hazardous Asteroid flag (1 or 0)  |
| `H`         | Absolute magnitude                             |
| `diameter`  | Diameter in kilometers                         |
| `albedo`    | Geometric albedo                              |
| `a`, `e`, `i` | Orbital elements: semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination |
| Others      | Various orbital and physical parameters        |

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed rows with missing critical values due to a high number of nulls in features like diameter and albedo.  
2. **Feature Scaling:** Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize features for better model convergence.  
3. **Handling Class Imbalance:** Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class (hazardous asteroids).  
4. **Model Architecture:** Built a simple feedforward neural network with sigmoid output for binary classification.  
5. **Training & Evaluation:** Trained with early stopping and evaluated performance metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results Summary

- The model achieves around **91% recall** on the hazardous asteroid class, improving detection of rare but critical samples.  
- Overall accuracy exceeds 99%, but accuracy alone is misleading due to class imbalance.  
- F1-score for the minority class is about 0.49, indicating room for improvement.
